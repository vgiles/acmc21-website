This year’s conference theme is connections. We want to connect the diverse range of people who contribute to Australia’s computer/electronic music culture, including and especially artists and scholars who are young/emerging, from regional/remote areas, who have a disability, who are First Nations People, who have low/no income, who are engaged in community music making, are trans and/or gender diverse, or who simply work outside of academia and mainstream institutions.
