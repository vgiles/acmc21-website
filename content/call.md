ACMC is the annual gathering of the Australasian Computer Music Association, a place to show and discuss research and artistic progress in computer/electronic music. It’s a festival of performances, installations, workshops, and tutorials that inspire, challenge, and showcase our community.

The synthposium will introduce the 3-day conference with specialised workshops, performances and presentations highlighting the resurgence in hardware synthesis in today’s music making toolkit! 

This year’s ACMC theme is connections. We want to connect the diverse range of people who contribute to Australia’s computer/electronic music culture, including and especially artists and scholars who are gender diverse, young/emerging, from regional/remote areas, who have a disability, who are First Nations People, who have low/no income, who are engaged in  community music making, or who simply work outside of academia and mainstream institutions.

In keeping with our theme, remote/online connections (internet streaming options) will be available for presenters/attendees. 

Submissions are open from May 1, 2021 with the opportunity to provide feedback and engage in conversation with all interested participants. Conference attendees/presenters can nominate which state/venue they wish to attend for ACMC’21 (+Synthposium).
