ACMC is the annual gathering of the Australasian Computer Music Association, a place to show and discuss research and artistic progress in computer/electronic music. It’s a festival of performances, installations, workshops, and tutorials that inspire, challenge, and showcase our community.

Synthmoot will introduce the 3-day conference with specialised workshops, performances and presentations highlighting the resurgence in hardware synthesis in today’s music making toolkit! 

This year’s ACMC theme is _connections_. We want to connect the diverse range of people who contribute to Australia’s computer/electronic music culture, including and especially artists and scholars who are gender diverse, young/emerging, from regional/remote areas, who have a disability, who are First Nations People, who have low/no income, who are engaged in  community music making, or who simply work outside of academia and mainstream institutions.

In keeping with our theme, remote/online connections (internet streaming options) will be available for presenters/attendees. 

Submissions are open from May 1, 2021 with the opportunity to provide feedback and engage in conversation with all interested participants. Conference attendees/presenters can nominate which state/venue they wish to attend for ACMC21 (+ Synthmoot).
