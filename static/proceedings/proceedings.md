# Getting Started in Visual Music and AudioVisual Improv

## [Mark Pedersen](mailto:mark@chailight.com) and Brigid Burke

### Abstract

As co-curators of SeenSound, a Melbourne-based visual music and
audio-visual improv series, we propose a practical workshop which
introduces participants to both the concepts and the practice of visual
music and audio-visual improv through engagement with historical
examples and hands-on creation of their own performances, either
individually or in small groups.

The practical elements of the workshop will focus on relatively low-cost
software and equipment, including open-source software, raspberry pi
computing platforms and older / DIY audio-visual equipment that is
affordable. The workshop will focus on a playful approach to technology
and visual music concepts and will not assume familiarity with formal
academic context or prior experience with technology. Participants with
advanced technical skills or knowledge will be encouraged to make room
for newcomers and engage with a \"beginner\'s mind\" while exploring the
audiovisual space as a way of refreshing their own creative practice.

## More Information

Topics covered will include:

* building a sense of connection and reciprocity between audio and visual material
* strategies for collecting and assembling raw material
* the use of synthesis vs. concrete materials
* strategies for audiovisual performance

# Enter the Packetsphere: Environment-Aware Web Art. 
## [Zak Argabrite](mailto:notprovided@null.null)
 
### Abstract
This paper addresses approaches to the web browser as an artistic medium, and how that artistic medium is inherently connected to the earth and the people who inhabit it. It focuses on a recent web art piece titled Packetsphere developed by two of the paper’s authors (Argabrite and Brown). The idea of the browser-as-medium is introduced by providing an overview of historical and contemporary examples of art on the web. The internet’s usage in art will then be further contextualized through an investigation into its real-world implications, with an emphasis placed on the wide-reaching environmental impacts and ethics of internet usage (especially for art). These two paths of inquiry will aid and be aided by an in-depth analysis of Packetsphere, a research-based creative output that focuses on salvaging historical expressions of the web while educating about its potential dangers. This is creatively delivered as an abstract travelogue-style journey through the physical infrastructure of the internet. Information about current realities and consequences of the internet with salvaged media and sounds of the historical web. Through this investigation a better understanding of the very real consequences of our virtual spaces will be met via a creative practice lens. 

# Farm Music: A Collaboration with Junk.
## [Bridget Johnson](mailto:b.d.johnson@massey.ac.nz)

### Abstract
The creation of collaborative works with non-musicians can often dictate new and different approaches to technology development and compositional strategies. This paper explores approaches to development of new music technology that is designed for, but removed from, a compositional process with non-musicians. It discusses the creative process for the development of a system for sonic actuation of farm junk that was part of the ‘Farm Music’ project installed at New Zealand’s Taranaki Arts Festival 2020. The paper looks at the actuation systems that were developed as well as compositional control systems for them. It also discusses the farm objects that were used in the installation and the considerations for actuation of farm junk in this public installation context. Farm Music was a collaboration with music therapist Chris O’Connor and producer Sally Barnett. The project engaged with community members with a focus on engaging men from local farms to focus on their mental health. A series of workshops were run by Chris O’Connor that encouraged the participants to look and listen for sounds in everyday objects. The participants then spent time collecting resonant objects from their farms and brought them to be part of the installation. The installation itself was designed to display the work that participants had completed as well as provide an opportunity for public engagement with the work and the sound making processes.  
The systems developed for the work needed to be modular so that whatever junk was found and brought to the installation was able to be actuated. From a technical perspective, the project involved the development of three different actuation systems that aligned with different temporal approaches discussed by music O’Connor: a drone, a scribble, and a strike. In order to create these sounds, surface transducers were used to create drones, motors with soft striking mechanisms for scribbles, and solenoids for strikes. In order to keep all systems modular, they were designed to be attached to mic stands so that final settings of actuators could be flexible depending on the items at the installation.  
The presentation discusses and shows the challenges and successes of working in this manner. Further, this presentation provides an as outline for conceptual and technical realizations of the work.  

# Sonic Cure - Percussion Inspired Modular Synthesizer Interface in Augmented Reality
## [Weitong Huang](mailto:notprovided@null.null)

### Abstract
This paper describes a synthesizer interface that can be controlled using basic physical interactions between virtual objects in HoloLens 2 with augmented reality (AR) technology. We start by talking about high level designs, including our initiatives of creating this interface. And in the following section, we talk about implementation details of the virtual space and the sound-making mechanism. Finally, we conclude our work by a demonstration video showing our work, Sonic Cure. We would like to view our work as a novel musical performance tool rather than an actual art installation. And we address this in the future work section. 

### Description: 
Sonic Cure is an art inspired musical interface created using the Augmented Reality (AR) technology on the Microsoft HoloLens 2. At the beginning of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic started, people around the world were forced to stay at home. The lockdown caused a lot of stress over the population. Japanese composer and artist Mr. Sakamoto Ryuichi published several percussive art pieces onto YouTube to help relief stress and meditation. I came across those pieces and thought it would be a great idea that we be able to do similar performances in a virtual space while also interacting with the surroundings. Therefore, we designed our work, Sonic Cure, to be using intuitive clashing and rubbing actions to create different sounds in AR space so as to provide such environment as well as creating connection between performer and audiences as they share the same physical space.

### Abstract
JWPATON is a Yuin artist and musician currently living on Darug Country, Blue Mountains. Working with lofi field recordings, JWPATON creates layered, processed manipulations of original source material. By pushing the limitations of digital software and a minimal modular synth setup, he creates long form ambient soundtracks. 

# The Lost
## Sze Tsang
### Abstract
The Lost is an audio-visual contemplation of the sensation of loss, and the subsequent feelings of dislocation. The work is based on a map of Perth from 1838, detailing many of Perth's now-lost wetlands, as well as a field recording from Herdman's Lake and sonified longitudinal and latitude values. The Lost is an exploration of connections between artist, history and place, and how these aspects can inform and intersect in a piece of work.  

# Artefacts
## Daniel Markulic
### Abstract
As technology evolves so too does role of the composer. Instead of letting technology take roles from us, we should expand our borders of what being a composer encapsulates so that we can include these new technologies as a tool of composition, rather than a means of creation. This piece composes with less traditional elements of music and technology, mainly, artefacts –both digital and organic.  
The score was created by allowing an Artificial Intelligence meant for creating realistic landscapes, to interpret a traditional score. The output is an abstract visual of images that feel simultaneously familiar and unfamiliar. The performer has been given rules on how to interact the score and create music from the images shown.  
When exposed to any image an individual creates connections from both extrinsic and intrinsic factors, whether they be cultural or from learned experiences. Creating an image void of connections allows us to an understanding of what is absolutely necessary in a score, and what is just noise. 

# Synth Building in CSound With the Cabbage Framework
## Jon Christopher Nelson 
### Abstract

Csound is a sound and music computing system that is a direct descendant of the MusicN family of computer music languages. It is an incredibly powerful and flexible coding environment. Cabbage is a framework that provides flexible graphic user interface widgets that can be used to control Csound code in real time. This workshop will provide an overview of the basic syntax of the Csound within Cabbage. Participants will learn how to create and modify a basic software synthesizer from a simple template. No previous experience with Csound or Cabbage is required, but participants are encouraged to download and install Cabbage on their own computer so they can actively participate in this session.  

### Additional Information for Participants

The basic Cabbage installation includes Csound and can be found at [https://cabbageaudio.com/download/]


# Mutatis Mutandis: Using Computational Thinking to Interpret Scores by Herbert Brün  
## James Aylward 

###Abstract
This discussion examines the work Mutatis Mutandis (1968/1995) by early computer music pioneer, Herbert Brün (1918-2000).  Brün started his work with computer music in the late 1950s in Paris, then the WDR studio in Cologne and the Siemens studio in Munich.  In 1962 he was invited by Lejaren Hiller to join the faculty at the University of Illinois where he remained for the rest of his working life.  
Next to music, Brün was also a computer graphic artist, a cybernetician, and actively interested in the political and social aspects of music and composition.  It is these elements that influence his work Mutatis Mutandis.  In this piece, Brün presents a number of computer generated graphics, but instead of treating these graphics like a score, performer is given instructions to “construct, by thought and imagination, the interpreter’s version of a structure that might leave the traces which the graphic displays.”  In this sense, he sought a means of stimulating the idea of structured process for the “composing interpreter” rather than simply an activity in attempted reconstruction.  This meta approach can challenge how we view the capability of computers to generate music and what graphic scores can communicate to the performer.  
The author will document and reflect upon the process of preparation of this work for performance. In seeking to develop a version which best combines his creative talents within the bounds of the score, the author will try to develop a deeper understanding and what it means to creatively apply principles of “algorithmic thought” and “cybernetics” to an acoustic performance.  He will also present a recording of a performance of this piece that will demonstrate how computers can indirectly be used to inspire creativity.

# Musica ex machina: integrating the sonic pallet of machines with acoustic instruments.
## Lindsay Vickery 

### Abstract

Californian composer Robert Erickson was one of the first to directly search for the “music in non-musical sounds” as the inspiration of music with acoustic instruments and electronics. He pioneered the use of analog spectrography to visualise the shapes of complex sound objects. This paper examines the evolution of the practice integrating of pre-recorded mechanical sounds and acoustic instruments. The foundations of the practice of exploring mechanical sound sound as a subject for 'musical' investigation is discussed in relation to Modernist developments including Futurism and Musique Concrète. The discussion will focus on w orks from the last 50 years by Robert Erickson (1917-97), Barry Traux (1947-) Peter Ablinger (1959-), Annie Gosfield (1960-) , James Saunders (1972-) , Joanna Bailie (1973-) and the author.  Techniques employed by composers for combining mechanical sounds and acoustic instruments including spectral analysis, sonification, transcription, resynthesis and transformation will be considered. Issues regarding coordination and sound projection of live and pre-recorded elements will also be addressed.
